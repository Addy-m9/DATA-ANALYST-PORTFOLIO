# Global Terrorism Analysis - Power BI

üåçExcited to present my newest endeavor: an extensive Global Terrorism Dashboard, revealing vital insights and trends. üíºüí°

Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the security of the international community. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), in order to quantitatively study past terrorist attacks and their temporal and spatial evolution the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to classify the degree of damage from terrorist attacks. The various factors influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three dimensions.

Key Findings:

1. Regional Hotspots: Identify regions most affected by terrorism, pinpointing areas of heightened risk and facilitating targeted interventions.

2. Trend Analysis: Uncover evolving patterns and tactics employed by terrorist groups, enabling proactive countermeasures and strategic responses.

3. Impact Assessment: Assess the socio-economic impact of terrorism on affected communities, informing resource allocation and humanitarian efforts.

4. Demographic Insights: Explore demographic profiles of perpetrators and victims, offering nuanced understanding for tailored prevention strategies.

5. Technological Solutions: Harness cutting-edge technology to enhance data visualization and predictive analytics, fostering actionable intelligence for stakeholders.
